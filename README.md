Project Title: Weirdest Amazon Orders
Project Overview:
‘Weirdest Amazon Orders’ is a fun and quirky web application where users can log in to share and explore lists of the most bizarre items they've purchased on Amazon. The platform allows users to document their purchases, upload images, and describe their weird shopping moments. A regret meter and community voting add a layer of humor and engagement, letting users rank the weirdest and funniest orders.
Key Features:
User Authentication:
Secure user login and registration using JWT for authentication.
Password storage secured with bcrypt hashing.
Personalized Lists:
Each user can maintain a unique list of their Amazon purchases.
Entries include item name, description, photo upload, and regret level.
Community Interaction:
Users can browse and upvote entries shared by others.
A leaderboard displays the top-voted weird purchases.
Regret Meter:
Users can rate how much they regret each purchase on a scale of 1-10.
